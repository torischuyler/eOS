# eOS Lesson Plans

A collection of lesson plans for students on media and digital literacy and for developers on computer basics,
laying the groundwork for an educational operating system (eOS).

This repository contains lesson plans for:

- **Students**: Media and digital literacy skills to help K-12 students navigate the digital world.
- **Developers**: Fundamentals of computer systems, starting with the boot process and kernel.

## About

The goal is to build a foundation for eOS, an OS designed for education.
More context lives in the code files - each is heavily documented.
This project is also a sandbox for exploring and demonstrating programming skills.

## Status

In very early development - think "embryonic stage" early (ðŸ‘¶) as of March 2025.

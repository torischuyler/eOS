# eOS Lesson Plans Code Of Conduct

## Let’s Keep It Chill 😎

We’re all here to build something cool, so let’s make this a space for everyone
—no matter who you are or where you’re coming from. (Unless you’re a mosquito or NYC rat—then yeah, GTFO.)

## Be a Good Human 🫶

- Respect all takes and backgrounds.
- Embrace feedback, especially the tough stuff—it’s how we grow.
- Keep the focus on making the project excellent.
- Try to genuinely see things from others’ point of view before judging.
- Mistakes happen. Don’t aim to harm, love your fellow humans, and own your slip-ups.

## Our Deal 🤝

Project maintainers are responsible for setting the tone and will step in if needed.
As maintainers we'll handle any issues fairly to keep things on track.

## Scope 🔭

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Got a Problem? ⚠️

For problems you can contact the project team at <tori.schuyler@icloud.com>. We’ll look into it, keep it confidential, and sort it out.

## Attribution 🙏

This is inspired by the Contributor Covenant, but we made it our own.
Check it at [contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html) if you’re curious.

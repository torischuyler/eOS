<!-- 
  Tells browsers "Hey, this is a modern HTML5 webpage!"

  Here's a lil history 📚:
  - When HTML was first introduced in 1991, it was super basic - just text and links.
  - HTML5 officially came along in 2014, brought to you by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - 
  the ppl that keep the web running smoothly.
  - HTML5 added cool stuff like video players, drawing tools, and better mobile support.

  Here's a lil gem 💎:
  - This DOCTYPE declaration is the only comment you'll see AFTER the code in this HTML file.
  - Why? Because it needs to be the very first thing in an HTML document for proper rendering
    and validation (browsers can be pretty picky about this).

  And one more lil thing 🔥:
  -  We're still using HTML5 today. Instead of an HTML6, HTML5 evolves through continuous updates. 
  It's like a "living standard", always getting better without changing its name.

  Kind of like we evolve as people - we change, but we keep our first name.
  (Except if you are like me and had your name changed from Katherine > Victoria 
  bc there were too many Kates in the 90s. And to add to the complexity I go
  by the nickname Tori. And I had a phase during childhood where for some 
  reason I wanted to be called "Ned" and convinced girls on my soccer team to call me that).
  
  There are always some expections to rules 😂 these are sometimes referred to as 
  "edge cases" or "corner cases" in software development.

  But for the most part, ppl keep their first name.

  Early on my software engineering journey, I was told by smart ppl
  that naming is one of the hardest things to do in software development.

  I think I understand and agree. Picking a name is hard, even for parents!
  Even for how we name generations of ppl.
  Choosing a name could change the whole trajectory of a thing...even before it's a thing.
  Okay, that's enough deep philosophical stuff for now! 😄 But I think is some insight to why naming is hard.
  
  Optional lil modifications 🧘:
  - If you're into this stuff, check out W3C: https://www.w3.org/
  - If not, that's cool too. You could always come back to it later.

# This file is _config.yml—see the underscore?
# It tells Jekyll this isn’t a page, just setup stuff.
# We’re using it to clean up our URLs by dropping the .html, making them pretty.
# (e.g. https://torischuyler.github.io/eOS/who-am-i instead of
# https://torischuyler.github.io/eOS/who-am-i.html)
# Both will still work, it's just nicer without the .html.

# Core Security Rules for Static Site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python)

# General Security
- Use HTTPS for all network requests (e.g., fetch in JavaScript, requests in Python scripts).
- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all CDN-hosted scripts (e.g., Chart.js, Chart.js plugins) to verify their integrity. Specify versioned URLs and include `integrity` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attributes. 
- Future: For dynamic CDN scripts (e.g., Tailwind CSS), consider hosting locally or using versioned URLs if SRI is not feasible.
- Future proof: Sanitize all user inputs in JavaScript to prevent XSS attacks.
- Future proof: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in environment variables, not hardcoded in JavaScript or Python.

# JavaScript-Specific
- Use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` for DOM manipulation to avoid XSS.
- Avoid inline JavaScript in HTML (e.g., <script> or onclick attributes).

# Python-Specific
- Future proof: Validate and sanitize inputs in Python scripts if processing user data (e.g., use `bleach` for HTML).

# Project-Specific
- Follow 2-space indentation for JavaScript, 4-space for Python.
- Future proof: Do not commit sensitive files (e.g., `.env`) to version control.

# Database Security
- Store database files (e.g., `phi_digits.db`) in a private folder (e.g., `python/digitize_phi`) that is not accessible by the web server.
- Exclude SQLite files from version control by adding `*.sqlite` and `*.db` to `.gitignore`.

    📐 Why is there no unit of measurement here for 1.6 like rem or px?

    Great question! Unitless values are standard for line-height in modern CSS
    because they adapt better than fixed units.

    🍭 1.6 is in the sweet spot between too cramped (< 1.5) and too spacious (> 2.0).

    Rem = “root em,” based on the <html> font size (usually 16 px by default).
    So, 1rem = 16px, 2rem = 32px. Simple math! 🧮
    2rem applies to all sides (top, right, bottom, left).

    Why use rem here? It’s responsive—padding scales with browser font size changes,
    keeping the nav balanced across different screens and settings.

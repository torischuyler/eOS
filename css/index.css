  📲 Home Container Tablet/Desktop Styles

  The 768px width is widely used because it aligns with the typical screen size
  of tablets in portrait mode, like the iPad (which has a resolution of 768px wide
  at 1x pixel density). It’s a common breakpoint in responsive design to shift from
  "mobile" to "tablet" layouts. Using min-width: 769px ensures these styles start
  right after the mobile styles (up to 768px), avoiding overlap at exactly 768px.
*/
@media (width >= 769px) {
  .home-container {
    /* --- Size It --- */

    /* 
      max-width: 80vw sets the maximum width to 80% of the viewport width.
      This prevents the container from growing too wide on larger screens, 
      enhancing readability by limiting line lengths and maintaining a focused layout.
    */
    max-width: 80vw;

ul li a { /* This targets links (<a>) that are inside list items (<li>) that are inside unordered lists (<ul>) */
    /* Padding in long form (explicit way) - like getting a long ass receipt from CVS 🧾 */
    padding-top: 0.3rem;
    padding-right: 0.625rem;
    padding-bottom: 0.3rem;
    padding-left: 0.625rem;

    padding: 0.3rem 0.625rem;

    /* 🤔 "Wait... why are both padding styles uncommented?"
    * 
    * PLOT TWIST: In CSS, when you have the same property declared twice,
    * the last one wins! So that shorthand padding above is actually 
    * overriding our CVS receipt version.
    *
    * Is this efficient? Nope! 
    * Would a linter be crying right now? Absolutely! Because:
    * - It's redundant to declare the same property twice.
    * - This can confuse developers reviewing or maintaining the code.
    * - It increases file size unnecessarily, even if just a tad.
    * - It might hint at a misunderstanding of how CSS cascades or specificity works.

    * Wondering tf is a linter? (It's a tool that checks your code for 
    * errors, style issues, and inefficiencies, like an annoying but 
    * helpful teacher).

    * Is your instructor twitching while purposely leaving inefficient
    * code uncommented? YOU BET! 
    * Are AI assistants everywhere struggling with their perfectionist programming? *nervous beep boops*
    * Are we all doing breathing exercises? Yes, yes we are. 🧘‍♀️
    *
    * Consider this your introduction to CSS specificity... and why caring
    * about quality code is a shared struggle among linters,
    * instructors, and AI assistants alike 😅

    Think of it as a color’s secret ID 🕵️‍♀️ A 6-digit code starting with # (like #4A90E2)
    mixes red, green, and blue (RGB) — two digits each: RRGGBB. You want pure black? #000000.
    Pure white? #FFFFFF. It’s how we talk color to computers.

  */

  /*
    Primary color: Deep Skyler is a rich, dark blackish-blue color.
    😎 Context: The hex code (#0D1B2A) doesn’t have a standard name, so gave it a personal touch -
    my last name, ‘Schuyler’ (pronounced like ‘Skyler’). The name is a play on:
      - It's dark, almost-black blue vibe, fitting for a dark mode design.
      - A nod to the recent LLM DeepSeek, tying it to tech innovation.
      - No color police here — when a color doesn't have a name, you can just name it!

    ✨ Note: This color offers strong contrast (~10:1 with Muad'Dib #C9C2BA) for
    accessibility in dark mode, reducing eye strain in low-light environments. It meets
    WCAG Level AAA standards (7:1 for normal text), ensuring top-tier readability.

    can help with the complex WCAG calculations.

  */
  --british-racing-green: #004225;

  /*
    Background and subheader text color: Lapis lazuli — a deep, rich blue color.
    😎 Fun Fact: Historically, lapis lazuli was ground into a pigment known as ultramarine,
    used by Renaissance artists for its vibrant blue hue.

    ✨ Note: This color offers sufficient contrast (~7:1 with White #FFFFFF) for
    accessibility in dark mode, reducing eye strain in low-light environments. It meets

    Text color: Pure white - a bright, clean text shade.
    😎 Context: Inspired by fresh snow on the mountains of Maine, it’s the ultimate contrast 
    against our lapis lazuli and chefchaouen blues.

    We use #FFF here instead of #FFFFFF ‘cause they’re the same color -
    linter likes the shorter version, less typing!
  */

  /*
    Contrast text color: Muad'Dib — a warm, earthy gray inspired by the desert mouse of Dune.

    — Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Dune by Frank Herbert.
  */

  /*
    Header text color: Hermès orange.
    Pronounced 'air-mez' like Air Bud but mez. 🐕🏀

    😎 Context: The Orange Box: Hermès is famous for its iconic orange packaging,
    which started as a happy accident. During World War II, wartime shortages forced
    the company to use the only paper stock available — an orange shade. What began as
    a necessity turned into a brand signature by the 1950s. Today, that vibrant orange
    (often described as a warm, poppy-like hue) is synonymous with luxury and instantly recognizable.

    🎨 Color Variations:
    Different representations of the Hermès orange show how brand colors can vary across mediums:
    #FF6600 - Traditional digital representation, brightest and most saturated.
    #F77F00 - Warmer, more muted variation with red undertones.
    #F37021 - Closest match to physical Hermès packaging, with a "burnt orange" quality.

    ⚠️ Note: Using special characters in CSS variables (like è) isn't recommended as it
    can cause encoding issues. For production, use: --hermes-orange instead.
    I am a renegade which is why we are doing it here. 😝

    😎 Fun fact: Sure, Georgia’s called the Peach State, but here’s the juicy twist -
    South Carolina is actually the second largest peach producer in the U.S. behind California.
  */
  --peach: #FACAA1;

  /*
    Subheader text color: Princeton orange.
    😎 Fun teacher facts: In 1989, while at Princeton, Wendy Kopp laid out the vision for
    Teach For America in her senior thesis. Ms. Schuyler was born one year later and
    eventually became a teacher through Teach For America! She also lived and worked
    in Princeton from June 2015 to February 2017.

    Dark mode as default 🌑 — why it’s the base:

    Dark mode cuts glare and reduces eye strain 👀, making screens less of a
    punch to the retinas when you’re staring at code (or memes) for hours.
    It’s a game changer for some, calming overstimulated senses and boosting focus.
    Plus, it’s easier on eyes in dim rooms and might save battery on OLED screens.
    (Think iPhone X or later 📱 — all OLED.)

    This is the core palette, with light mode as the toggleable remix.

  */
  --charcoal: #2C3E50;

  /*
    Subheader text color: Poppy - a bright, warm red with just the right amount of orange undertone.
    😎 Fun Fact: Poppies close their petals at night and during bad weather, then open them again when 
    conditions improve! They're like natural weather predictors. Ancient sailors actually used to 
    watch poppies to help forecast the weather - if the flowers closed up during the day, 
    they knew a storm might be coming. The flowers' movement is called "nyctinasty" - 
    it's a response to changes in temperature and humidity.
  */
  --poppy: #E23D28;

  /*
    Subheader text color: Moonstone inspired, a medium-light blue with a slight gray undertone.
    😎 Fun Context: Moonstone has a unique optical effect called "adularescence" which creates 
    a floating blue-white glow that moves across the stone when tilted. This ethereal effect, 
    resembling moonlight through clouds, led Ancient Romans to believe the stones 
    contained actual captured moonbeams. Moonstone is also one of the three birthstones for June,
    the month Ms. Schuyler was born in! Pearl and alexandrite are the other two.

    metal type printing to modern web design.

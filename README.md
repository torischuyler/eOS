# eOS Experiemtns

A collection of kid-friendly lesson plans designed for young learners, focusing on media and digital literacy,
and for aspiring developers exploring computer basics. These resources lay the groundwork for an educational
operating system (eOS) tailored to spark curiosity and learning in children.

This repository contains lesson plans for:

- **Young Learners**: Fun, engaging media and digital literacy lessons to help K-12 kids safely and confidently navigate the digital world.
- **Developers**: Easy-to-understand fundamentals of computer systems, starting with the boot process and kernel, crafted for young minds eager to explore tech.

## About

The goal is to create a foundation for eOS, an educational operating system designed specifically for kids and young learners.
Each lesson and code file is packed with clear, friendly explanations to inspire learning and creativity. This project also serves as a playful sandbox
to explore and showcase programming skills in a safe, supportive environment.

## Status

In very early development - think "just getting started" early (ðŸ‘¶) as of March 2025.

A collection of lesson plans for students on media and digital literacy, and for developers on computer basics, aiming towards the dream of an educational OS.

# Lesson Plans

Welcome to my project where I'm hosting lesson plans for:

- **Students**: Focused on media literacy and digital literacy to navigate the digital world.
- **Developers**: Lessons on how computers work, starting with the boot process and kernel, to build a foundation for an educational operating system.

This repository is a work in progress, where I'll be posting simple, educational lesson plans.

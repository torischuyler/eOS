                            June 18th is Golden Ratio Day! Right now, it's just me celebrating on 6/18‚Äî1 plus the date makes it a golden party of 1.618.
                            (Bad math joke lol). But hopefully, more people will learn about it and join me!
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <strong>Alright, what's the golden ratio?</strong> ü§®
                            It's kinda like the other cool number everyone's always going on about‚Äîpi (œÄ).
                            Like pi, the golden ratio aka ‚Äúphi (œÜ)‚Äù is an infinite and irrational number.
                            What makes it ‚Äúgolden‚Äù? Well, this special number can be found in shapes and patterns that humans
                            find naturally pleasing to the eye, appearing throughout nature and art as
                            a divine proportion of perfect harmony.
                            <br><br>

                                <summary><i>How To Say Phi üì£</i></summary>
                                The pronunciation of phi is a hot topic for debate: is it ‚Äúfie‚Äù (rhyming with pi) or ‚Äúfee‚Äù?
                                In University Greek Life, like with the Alpha Phi sorority, it's ‚Äúfee‚Äù‚Äîthe original Greek way.
                                I'm torn, though‚ÄîI lean toward ‚Äúfie‚Äù since it rhymes with ‚Äúpi‚Äù and ‚Äúsky‚Äù
                                (and my last name is Schuyler, pronounced SKY-ler).

                           <strong>What are irrational numbers, are they kinda crazy?</strong>
                            Yeah, in a way! An irrational number is a number that can't be written as a simple fraction, like 1/2 or 3/4.
                            Irrational numbers go on forever without repeating. Check out the first 11 digits of pi and phi:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    pi (œÄ) = 3.1415926535...
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    phi (œÜ) = 1.6180339887...
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we celebrate Pi Day on March 14th (3/14) <strong><i>because of the first 3 numbers of pi</i></strong> and we celebrate
                            Golden Ratio Day on June 18th (6/18) <strong><i>because of the first 3 decimal digits of phi</i></strong>.  And okay I'll admit it:
                            part of the reason I choose to celebrate on this awesome June day is because it's my birthday too ü•≥. Keep reading to find out how
                            this epic number shows up IRL!

                            The golden ratio can be found in nature if you know where to look. Let's find the golden ratio in sunflowers
                            and, as I originally hail from the Pine Tree State of Maine, we'll look at pinecones too.

                                The golden ratio shapes how a sunflower arranges its seeds in spiral patterns, with each seed positioned approximately 137.5 degrees
                                (the golden angle) from the previous one. This arrangement allows the sunflower to pack seeds efficiently, maximizing space while
                                minimizing overlap. The result is a highly optimized structure that supports healthy development and ensures each floret has
                                good exposure to sunlight during growth.

                            <p>
                                A sunflower's seed head often has spiral counts that match Fibonacci numbers, like 34 spirals going in a clockwise direction and 55 going
                                counterclockwise. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two before it. It starts with 0 and 1,
                                so it goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 and so on. This pattern emerges naturally as the sunflower grows, with each new
                                seed positioning itself at the golden angle from the previous seed. The ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers (like 55/34) approaches
                                the golden ratio (1.618...), demonstrating how this mathematical principle directly manifests in the flower's physical structure.

                            June 18th is Golden Ratio Day! Right now, it's just me celebrating on 6/18—1 plus the date makes it a golden party of 1.618.
                            (Bad math joke lol). But hopefully, more people will learn about it and join me!
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <strong>Alright, what's the golden ratio?</strong> 🤨
                            It's kinda like the other cool number everyone's always going on about—pi (π).
                            Like pi, the golden ratio aka “phi (φ)” is an irrational number.
                            What makes it “golden”? Well, this special number can be found in shapes and patterns that humans
                            find naturally pleasing to the eye, appearing throughout nature and art as
                            a divine proportion of perfect harmony.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>How do we get this golden ratio phi number anyways?</strong> 🤷‍♀️ Let's say you take a line and split it into two parts 
                            (a bigger one and a smaller one). The magic happens when the ratio of the <i>whole line</i> to the <i>bigger part</i> is exactly 
                            the same as the ratio of the <i>bigger part</i> to the <i>smaller part.</i> That special ratio is the golden ratio, phi, which
                            turns out to be 1.618...!

                                <summary><i>How To Say Phi 📣</i></summary>
                                The pronunciation of phi is a hot topic for debate: is it “fie” (rhyming with pi) or “fee”?
                                In University Greek Life, like with the Alpha Phi sorority, it's “fee”—the original Greek way.
                                I'm torn, though—I lean toward “fie” since it rhymes with “pi” and “sky”
                                (and my last name is Schuyler, pronounced SKY-ler).
                                <br><br>
                                How do <i>you</i> say phi?

                           <strong>What are irrational numbers, are they kinda crazy?</strong>
                            Yeah, in a way! An irrational number is a number that can't be written as a simple fraction, like 1/2 or 3/4.
                            Irrational numbers go on forever without repeating. Check out the first 11 digits of pi and phi:

                            It's interesting that when we're referring to the number shorthand for Pi, we reference only
                            the first 2 decimal digits (3.14) but when we reference Phi we typically go 3 places (1.618).

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Pi (3.14):</strong> Favors simplicity and “good enough” accuracy for widespread, basic use.
                                    Convention plays a huge role. And also perhaps cemented by Einstein's March 14 birthday sharing pi's digits 😜
                                    <strong>Fun fact: you know that famous picture of Einstein sticking his tongue out? 
                                        That was taken on his 72nd birthday! (March 14, 1951).

                                    <strong>Phi (1.618):</strong> Favors slightly higher precision to better distinguish the value
                                    and capture its essence, especially since the next digit is 0, making 1.618 a really good cutoff.

                            So we celebrate Pi Day on March 14th (3/14) <strong><i>because of the first 3 numbers of pi</i></strong> and we celebrate
                            Golden Ratio Day on June 18th (6/18) <strong><i>because of the first 3 decimal digits of phi</i></strong>.  And okay I'll admit it:
                            part of the reason I choose to celebrate on this awesome June day is because it's my birthday too 🥳. Keep reading to find out how

                            The golden ratio can be found in nature if you know where to look. Let's find the golden ratio in sunflowers.

                        <img src="../images/golden-ratio/sunflower.jpg" class="sunflower-image" alt="close-up of a sunflower disc with golden ratio spirals in florets,

                        <h4>Efficiency</h4>
                         <p>
                            The golden ratio shapes how a sunflower arranges its seeds in spiral patterns, with each seed positioned approximately 137.5 degrees
                            (the golden angle) from the previous one. This arrangement allows the sunflower to pack seeds efficiently, maximizing space while
                            minimizing overlap. The result is a highly optimized structure that supports healthy development and ensures each floret has
                            good exposure to sunlight during growth.
                         </p>

                        <h4>Fibonacci Connection</h4>
                        <p>
                            A sunflower's seed head often has spiral counts that match Fibonacci numbers, like 34 spirals going in a clockwise direction and 55 going
                            counterclockwise. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two before it. It starts with 0 and 1,
                            so it goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 and so on. This pattern emerges naturally as the sunflower grows, with each new
                            seed positioning itself at the golden angle from the previous seed. The ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers (like 55/34) approaches
                            the golden ratio (1.618...), demonstrating how this mathematical principle directly manifests in the flower's physical structure.

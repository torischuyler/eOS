    <h1>Digitize Phi</h1>
    <p>Exploring the decimal digits of φ (1.6180339887...)</p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Digitize Phi project! This page documents a year-long exploration into the
        decimal digits of the golden ratio, φ. The project, which began on June 26, 2025, and will 
        conclude on June 26, 2026, reveals 10,000 new decimal digits of φ each day. The image below, 
        titled “Daily Histogram,” is a static visualization of the frequency of the digits 0 through 9 
        for today's 10,000 digits. To see visualizations from previous days, please visit the link below 
        titled “Histogram Archive.” Further down, the “Dynamic Histogram” is a cumulative and interactive 
        chart displaying the frequency of all digits collected since the project's inception. This allows 
        you to see how the distribution of digits is evolving over time.

        “Geometry has two great treasures: one is the Theorem of Pythagoras; the other, the division 
        of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first we may compare to a measure of gold; 
        the second we may name a precious jewel.” 💎

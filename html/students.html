DOCTYPE declaration, it essentially tells browsers "Hey, this is an HTML webpage."

This is the "Students" page, designed to provide lesson plans
on media literacy and digital literacy for students.

<html lang="en">
<!-- Sets the page language to English - helps screen readers, search engines, and spell checkers. -->

        speeding up resource loading from those sites.
        - 'crossorigin' enables secure loading from different domains for fonts.gstatic.com;
        Not needed for fonts.googleapis.com since it's just establishing a connection, not loading content. -->

        <!-- Stylesheets:
        - A stylesheet is a file that tells the browser how to style the HTML content.
        - Local stylesheets (loaded first) for speed, then third-party.
        This order prevents local styles from being accidentally overridden by external CSS. -->

        <!-- Script for toggling dark/light mode - placed last for better page load performance and security.
        'defer' tells the browser to load the script after the HTML is parsed but before
        the DOMContentLoaded event, improving page load times. -->

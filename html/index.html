<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
DOCTYPE declaration, it essentially tells browsers "Hey, this is an HTML webpage."

This index.html is the homepage, ensuring compatibility, portability,
and clarity across servers and for developers.

Best practice: We use index.html because:
    1. It's the default file servers look for when accessing a directory.
    2. It's an industry standard recognized across web servers.
    3. Visitors don't need to type the full filename in the URL.
    4. It works automatically with domain.com/ without redirects.
    5. It maintains consistency across different hosting environments.

This helps with:
    - Server compatibility
    - Clean URLs
    - SEO optimization
    - Developer familiarity

     It also affects page rendering and responsiveness. -->

     speeding up resource loading from those sites.
      - 'crossorigin' enables secure loading from different domains for fonts.gstatic.com; 
      Not needed for fonts.googleapis.com since it's just establishing a connection, not loading content.

     - A stylesheet is a file that tells the browser how to style the HTML content.

    <!-- Script for toggling dark mode - placed last for better page load performance and security.
     'defer' tells the browser to load the script after the HTML is parsed but before 
     the DOMContentLoaded event, improving page load times.
